.SYNOPSIS
    Arms the claude:// shim so the NEXT login routes to a chosen profile, and
    reasserts the protocol handler registration.

.DESCRIPTION
    Browser SSO returns to the app through a claude:// deep link. With several
    isolated profiles running, Windows would deliver that callback to whichever
    profile owns the protocol -- not necessarily the one you started logging
    into. Run this immediately BEFORE a login to state your intent:

        .\Arm-ClaudeLogin.ps1 -Profile Work         # next login -> the Work profile
        .\Arm-ClaudeLogin.ps1 -Profile Personal     # next login -> the default profile

    Arming is a deliberate, one-shot statement about the next login -- the shim
    resets to 'default' after it fires (see ClaudeOpenShim.ps1). This is on
    purpose: a "last-launched" heuristic misroutes the "personal re-auth while
    work was launched more recently" case, and a sticky marker silently lands
    tokens in the wrong profile weeks later.

    The profile set and its data/config directories come from profiles.json,
    which Setup.ps1 writes next to this script -- nothing here is hardcoded.

.PARAMETER Profile
    Name of a profile declared at setup (case-insensitive). The literal name
    'default' always disarms (routes to the stock profile); a profile bound to
    the stock paths at setup also disarms (its target is 'default').

.PARAMETER Launch
    After arming, also launch that profile's Claude window (via Launch-Claude.ps1)
    so the sign-in button is right there. Without this, arming only sets the
    marker + handler; trigger the login yourself from an already-open window.

.EXAMPLE
    .\Arm-ClaudeLogin.ps1 -Profile Work -Launch

.NOTES
    Windows PowerShell 5.1. HKCU only -- no admin. Lives in the install bin\
    alongside ClaudeOpenShim.ps1, Launch-Claude.ps1, and profiles.json.
